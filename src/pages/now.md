# What I'm doing now

I'm currently reading two technical books: <em>Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code</em> and <em>Programming Lua</em>.

I'm developing a toy project for listing upcoming tech conferences with Next.js, tRPC, and Prisma.

I've been writing a few posts as well, one of them I released a couple of days ago: [Component Driven UI Patterns](/articles/component-driven-design), which is the first of a series I'm elaborating about components and how to understand their patterns.

Tinkering a bit with [LunarVIM](https://www.lunarvim.org/), which caught my interest as I began learning Lua in the last couple of months, and I'm planning to build a little theme with it.

Excited to the new season of Spring Anime! ðŸ“º 

As for games, I currently playing <em>Ni no Kuni Wrath of the White Witch</em>ðŸŽ®
